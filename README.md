# Line Following Robot ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

A simple autonomous robot built using **Arduino Uno** that follows a black/white line path using **IR sensors**.  
This project demonstrates the basics of **robotics, sensor integration, and motor control**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Follows a line path automatically using IR sensor input.  
- Uses **Arduino Uno** as the controller.  
- **DC motors + Motor Driver (L293D)** for movement.  
- Basic demonstration of **autonomous navigation**.  
- Beginner-friendly robotics project.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- IR Sensor Module (2 or more)  
- L293D Motor Driver Module  
- DC Motors with Wheels  
- Chassis (Robot Body)  
- Battery (9V / 12V)  
- Jumper Wires

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
1. The **IR sensors** detect the line (black line on white surface or vice versa).  
2. The Arduino reads the sensor values.  
3. Based on the line position, the Arduino sends signals to the **motor driver**.  
4. The motors adjust movement so the robot stays on the path.

## ðŸ”¹ Applications
1.Autonomous robots  
2.Industrial robots for path navigation.  
3.Educational projects for beginners in robotics.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1.Assemble the hardware.  
2.Upload the Arduino code to the Uno.  
3.Place the robot on a track (black line on white background recommended).  
4.Power the robot and watch it follow the line! ðŸš€
